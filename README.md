- Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.
- Parses the JSON response to extract temperature and condition information.

## Requirements

- requests library

**open Weather.py before run the file.
-The main functionality of the script includes fetching the weather data, parsing the temperature and weather condition from the JSON response, and printing the results to the console. It also handles error cases where the location is not found and displays an appropriate error message.
-The API key, API endpoint, and required functions for fetching and parsing the weather data are provided in the script. To use the script, you need to replace "YOUR_API" with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap and specify the location by entering the ZIP code in the location variable within the main function.
-This script serves as a basic example of how to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. It can be extended and customized according to specific requirements or integrated into other projects that involve weather data retrieval and processing.
